ABlib is an online learning app i created that is powered by Python/DjangoRF. Am currently still pushing updates to it occassionaly and would mind if you choose to contribute in fine tuning it.

Criteria to be a contributor:

You are a UI/UX developer
you should have atleast a basic understanding of python and django framework
you should be able to have python installed in your local machine as there is the only way you can run the application locally on your device
Send me a mail via Baronchibuike@gmail.com and let me know you want to be part of this project
How to run this project

As stated earlier, you should have python already installed on your local machine
Set up a virtual environment, you can follow the steps below Mkdir yourfolder cd yourfolder virtualenv Ablib(this will instal all the dependencies of the virtualenv) cd Ablib/scripts/activate then open the requirement.txt and download all the neccessary files to be able to run the project(Always starting with pip install ..)
Do a "git clone "https://github.com/Baronchibuikem/AbLib" and you are all set up.
About this project: This project was inspired by my need to document my tech journey in an organized matter and the author of "Django by example" provided the necessary guildlines on how to get this done. So each course created is meant to address a particular topic which will be divided into modules for users to better relate with.

Although i realized that people learn more watching videos of how to get things done, i intentionally choose to not add that functionality yet, so this project is heavily reliant on text and images.

You can choose to enroll and be a student or become an instructor.
